Notes:
To make sure production is updated with master branch
1.  commit and push master
2.  checkout the local production branch from IDEA lower right
3.  merge the local master branch
4.  run it to make sure it works.  Fix as necessary
5.  commit and push to production

Goal:  Make sure that production branch represents the code in the ms release and that master branch
represents the woj release.   I think I can then fix bugs in each and merge one branch into the other.


Releases:

11/8/16:  Added LC rules from Ivon which includes some fixes to the XMLLCRule tool for adding to the db and making rules and rulesets
that have one rule file and many ruleset files that just point to rules.   Tested the rules coming from oldLCBehavior.   This release also
includes Rafaels additions to the topic editor in the teacher tools.   Built some new ant scripts (auto-gened)  and then wrote buildSugaree.xml
which is a master script that imports the auto-gened ones.   The auto-gened ant scripts need to be done more frequently (i.e. when new Maven
dependencies are added ) because the Maven libs are part of the ant scripts.
Released both WOJ and MS systems and pushed to master and production

10/27/16:   Fixed bugs related to login interventions not behaving well with missing config.xml.
Also added long answers to surveys.

 Released WOJ and MS systems.
 Pushed both Repos (master and production) so that woj=master and production=ms
